The sun begins to peek out from behind the treeline, illuminating Uncle Hugo&rsquo;s house in hues of orange. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion clambers out of the passenger side of Nancy&rsquo;s car, shutting the door behind him and hefting his backpack onto his shoulder.

Take care, safe travels, Nancy!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Nancy rolls up the window, and begins to back out of the driveway. Her car slowly drifts out of view down the hill, until the noise of the engine fades into the background. Orion takes a deep breath, and steps to Uncle Hugo&rsquo;s front door. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">Knock, knock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The door clicks open, and Luna stands behind it, smiling wanly at Orion.

Suddenly, the large frame of Luna&rsquo;s uncle appears behind the girl, and he tosses the door open. He cracks a big grin at seeing Orion, and spreads his hands wide in a welcoming gesture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c5">Orion, </span><span class="c2">cabro&ndash;</span><span class="c0">er&hellip;my friend!

My niece here thinks very highly of you, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna turns slightly red and flicks her eyes away from Orion, who grins at her for only a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">Uncle Hugo, don&rsquo;t stray so far from reality&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c5">Ah, yes! Of course, of course, </span><span class="c2">nina</span><span class="c0">. Anyways, Orion, I&rsquo;ve got a big favor to ask of you. Lunita, would you go get Pancho?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna seizes upon the opportunity to remove herself from the situation before she gets any redder than she already is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Of course, Uncle! I&rsquo;ll be right back, Orion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She slips back into the house. Uncle Hugo smiles as he watches her leave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">What can I do for you, Mr. Hernandez?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">Orion, you certainly know that there are two things in this world that I value above all: my sweet niece Luna, and my precious boy Pancho. I have entrusted you with Luna, because I believe you are a great influence on her, and she seems very fond of you. It is now that I must entrust you with my second: Pancho.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Um&hellip;how so, Mr. Hernandez?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The smile vanishes from Uncle Hugo&rsquo;s face, and his eyes widen slightly. He takes a step towards Orion, and places a single hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">My mother and I are going out to town today&ndash;it&rsquo;ll be a drive of a few hours, and we will likely be gone until sunset. I am entrusting you with care of my Luna and my Pancho. If anything happens to either one of them, well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">Orion gulps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Uncle Hugo maintains dead eye contact with Orion, not blinking for even a moment. After an eternity in seconds passes, his smile returns and he lifts his hand from Orion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">But I know you won&rsquo;t let that happen, will you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">No! No, Mr. Hernandez, of course not! I&rsquo;d never let anyone&ndash;anything&ndash;at all come to harm either of them!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">Uncle Hugo claps his hands together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">Excellent! I&rsquo;m glad to hear it, Orion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna comes back, holding Pancho in her arms, and from the demure look on her face, over the initial teasing of her uncle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">Ahaha! There&rsquo;s my boy!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">He scratches Pancho&rsquo;s ruff, and the chicken clucks happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Just then, Luna&rsquo;s grandmother trots up behind Uncle Hugo, and reaches up to grab him by the ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA&rsquo;S GRANDMOTHER: </span><span class="c0">Hugo! We are going to be late if we continue at this pace!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She turns her stern gaze warm in an instant, spinning to face Orion and Luna.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA&rsquo;S GRANDMOTHER: </span><span class="c5">But where are my manners&ndash;it is good to see you, </span><span class="c2">mija</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Orion!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c5">Hi, </span><span class="c2">yaya</span><span class="c0">!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Hello, Mrs. Hernandez.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Uncle Hugo nods anxiously, and tries to twist out of the hold on his ear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(The Hernandez family really takes after each other, huh? Mr. Hernandez is the scariest guy in the room right up until his mom comes around.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c5">Of course, </span><span class="c2">mama</span><span class="c0">, I was just saying goodbye. Take care, Luna and&ndash;ow! Orion!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The two walk down the driveway to Uncle Hugo&rsquo;s SUV with Luna&rsquo;s grandmother still firmly grabbing Uncle Hugo&rsquo;s ear. Their voices fade until they climb into the car and start it up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA&rsquo;S GRANDMOTHER: </span><span class="c0">Unbelievable! I thought I raised you better than this!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c2">Mama, </span><span class="c0">we&rsquo;re an hour ahead of schedule!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna raises her eyebrows, still firmly clutching Pancho.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">My father tells me they were the same way growing up. Uncle Hugo was always the rebel of the family, and my father was the golden child. Anyway, should we&ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She gestures to Orion&rsquo;s backpack with her fingers, keeping a solid grasp on Pancho.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Oh, yeah. Good idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The two walk into the house, and Luna pushes the door shut with her foot behind her. Orion makes his way to the island, and drops the backpack onto the countertop. Unzipping it, he begins to pull out every ingredient that he and Nancy had purchased at the store earlier in the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Alright, let&rsquo;s see&hellip;onions, garlic, shallots, vinegar, ground beef&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">Cluck cluck!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion looks up at the noise, and not a moment later Pancho runs down the hallway and up the stairs, carrying with him a mysterious bag. Luna chases after him, sprinting up the stairs two at a time and hurriedly explaining to Orion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">Pancho took my&ndash;ah, something of mine! Stick with the ingredients, I don&rsquo;t want them to spoil! They&rsquo;d probably never find your body if you served my grandma meat that was ever room-temperature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(She can tell? Wait, did Luna say they&rsquo;d never find my body?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">A-alright!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He resumes inventorying with a greater direness to his situation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Garlic salt. Anise. Cilantro.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">After a few minutes, Luna comes back down the stairs, and pads towards Orion at the counter. Looking up, he notices with a slight curiosity that her hands are gloveless. She stops slightly to the side of him. Their mouths say nothing, their eyes; everything. Luna inches slightly closer. Then, slightly closer. Then, slightly closer. Their shoulders brush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: (</span><span class="c0">Oh shit, should I kiss her? Is she trying to&ndash;no, that&rsquo;s not like Luna. But she&rsquo;s right there, looking at me with those eyes.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t find Pancho.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion involuntarily smashes his fist down on the counter, instantly macerating a head of garlic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve got it! You keep, uh, sorting through the ingredients.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion begrudgingly breaks the contact between his shoulder and Luna&rsquo;s, and heads up the stairs to find Pancho. He mutters to himself as he walks down the still-unfamiliar hallway, peering into each room to find the missing chicken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION (softly): </span><span class="c0">Here, Pancho-Pancho-Pancho. Your dad&rsquo;s gonna put me in a grave if I can&rsquo;t find you&hellip;damn, if I was a chicken, where would I hide?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Suddenly, Orion&rsquo;s ears perk up. Soft sounds can be heard from the room at the end of the hallway, and Orion tiptoes to the slightly-ajar door. It opens with a </span><span class="c5">creak</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;into a room he hasn&rsquo;t seen before. Large windows dominate two of the walls, and a large, well-kept </span><span class="c5">bed sits</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;pushed against one wall. A picture of Uncle Hugo, Luna&rsquo;s father, and Luna&rsquo;s grandmother sits atop the nightstand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Probably Mr. Hernandez&rsquo;s room.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">Cluck, cluck. Cluck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With a sudden motion, Pancho darts out from under the bed, and in a flash of pure instinct Orion grabs him, scooping the chicken into a tight grasp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">PANCHO: </span><span class="c0">Bawk! Bawk! Bawk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He doesn&rsquo;t struggle, and simply looks at Orion with his two beady eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Maybe I&rsquo;ve been hanging around sentient animals in Eternum too much, but I swear this chicken is fucking with me.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Careful not to lose concentration on containing Pancho, Orion walks back down to find Luna at the counter, with each non-perishable ingredient laid out nicely in front of her. She gives a small smile, which widens when she notices Pancho in Orion&rsquo;s hands. The chicken, who was statue-still until then, wrenches himself from Orion&rsquo;s protection and flaps to Luna, brushing his head against her leg.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">We&rsquo;re good to start cooking! I&rsquo;ve got the stove on, and the saucepan is coated with margarine. We should first cook up the peppers and beans, then brown the meat and add seasonings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Great, yeah, yeah&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna nods, understanding his reservations. She rubs Pancho&rsquo;s neck, and the chicken makes a soft cooing noise and flaps up to a barstool at the counter. He sits there, and studies Orion for a moment before closing his eyes and nestling his head at his chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">He just gets the zoomies whenever someone first comes into the house.

The screen crackles to life, displaying a slightly washed-out and fuzzy scene of a busy street corner. Satisfied, Luna walks back to the couch and gathers her courage. She sits again, this time closer to Orion, and presses play on the remote.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">(A few uneventful hours go by, with the TV blaring near-unintelligible Spanish)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: (</span><span class="c0">We haven&rsquo;t moved in forever.

Is he still awake?)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She meets his eyes, and sees that he&rsquo;s looking at her at the same time. She darts her eyes away, but after a moment, looks back. Orion still smiles at her, the corners of his mouth wrinkling slightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">(Well, here goes&hellip;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna looks back at the television, and slowly leans over onto Orion, resting her head on his shoulder. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Oh god, this is happening.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He scoots closer to her, moving his own body to lean into Luna. They stay there for a while, and the TV continues to babble about love and betrayal, family and friends, youth and age&ndash;all in Spanish, of course. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Neither of them are listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">(Another hour passes.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion glances over at Luna, who is now fully asleep. A tiny tuft of hair falls into her face, and her breathing is slow and soft.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Ah, she&rsquo;s so adorable when she&rsquo;s sleeping.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He surveys the house around him, relishing every element of his situation. The house is filled with aromas both spicy and sweet, and the midday sun begins to wane, casting beams of light through the windows that trace around the edges of the living room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(I&rsquo;ve got a beautiful girl sleeping on me, good food cooking on the stove, and a satisfied chicken. No, life couldn&rsquo;t really get better right now.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">He admires the beautiful girl. He smells the heavenly scent of stewing birria. He does not see the chicken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Oh shit. I can either wake up Luna, or have Pancho gain ground on me every second I can&rsquo;t see him. He could be in another country by the time Luna wakes up&hellip;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">I felt you tense up, Orion. Is something wrong?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Thank god.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Pancho&rsquo;s gone again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna quickly stands up, breaking away from Orion&rsquo;s body heat in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Damn.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion stands up as well, shaking the fatigue from his muscles. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a streak of white feathers suddenly scrape through a hedge in the yard. Without another second of hesitation, Orion sprints to the patio door and flings it open, desperate to catch another glimpse of where Pancho went off to. The hedges near the front of he house rustle, and he runs over to investigate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion and Luna chase Pancho all around the yard for another while, unsuccessfully trying to work together to corner and capture the bird. At every turn, Pancho seems to elude them, darting between Orion&rsquo;s legs, jumping off of Luna&rsquo;s head, and squirming into small crevices or bushes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s over by the driveway again!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">Look, by the door. Maybe I try going to the left, and you go right this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Is he on the roof?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Pancho finally relents, and settles back inside on the couch. Orion and Luna nervously sit beside him, balancing their desire to keep the avian put with their desire to rest after running countless laps around Uncle Hugo&rsquo;s sizable house. Outside, the sun begins to melt behind the high mountains, dazzling the once-gray clouds with streaks of pink and red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">The air has gone hazy, and the scent of warm summer rain begins to c</span><span class="c5">rawl</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;through the open windows, cooling the two exhausted chicken parents as they fan themselves on the couch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c5">Are you alright if I&ndash;</span><span class="c2">huff</span><span class="c5">&ndash;take my shirt off? I think&ndash;</span><span class="c2">puff</span><span class="c0">&ndash;this might be the most tired I&rsquo;ve ever been.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna quickly nods.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c5">(Oh god, was that too enthusiastic? I don&rsquo;t want him thinking I&rsquo;m a perv for wanting his shirt off. I mean I </span><span class="c2">do </span><span class="c0">want his shirt off, but I don&rsquo;t want to come off as desperate. Maybe I&ndash;)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Damn, she&rsquo;s been nodding for a while now.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion slides his shirt over his head, pulling it onto his lap and reclining further. Waves of heat seem to emanate from him like radiation. He closes his eyes, and rests his head against the back of the sofa. After a while, he sits back up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Hey, the stew is probably&ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna has also removed her shirt, and is sitting with her feet put up on the ottoman. She wears a lacy black bra, seemingly unaware of the one undone strap draped around her upper arm. Her porcelain skin gleams with a thin coat of sweat from all the running around. She looks over at Orion, who hastily directs his eyes to meet hers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c2">Ahem. </span><span class="c0">Done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">Sounds good. I&rsquo;ll go check on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She gets up, and walks to the kitchen, pulling the lid off of the pot and releasing tides of scented steam all throughout the house. Giving Orion a thumbs-up, she replaces the lid and sits back down next to him on the couch. Just then, the front door creaks open, and Uncle Hugo&rsquo;s booming voice echoes off the walls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">We&rsquo;re hoooooooo-me!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Oh shit. Oh shit oh shit. We&rsquo;re both shirtless on his couch and covered in sweat.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The two scramble for their shirts, hastily covering themselves before attempting to act as natural as possible. Luna examines her nails while Orion whistles and looks wistfully out the window at the sunset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA&rsquo;S GRANDMOTHER: </span><span class="c0">My, this house smells wonderful! What are you two cooking over here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">She shuffles over to the pot and removes the lid, taking a wooden spoon and tasting the still-boiling concoction, making absolutely no reaction other than a slight </span><span class="c2">hm </span><span class="c0">of approval. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Uncle Hugo walks over to the couch and seats himself in between Orion and Luna, picking up Pancho and stroking his feathers lovingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">Ah, and now I&rsquo;m with all of my favorite people in the world. How was everything today, Pancho?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">PANCHO: </span><span class="c0">Bawk. Bawk cluck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Uncle Hugo raises his eyebrows, and interrogates the chicken with an incredulous tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c5">Orion and Luna did </span><span class="c2">what?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pancho, am I hearing you correctly?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">What? You can talk to the chicken?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">PANCHO: </span><span class="c0">Cluck-cluck bawk!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">Of course not! Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">(Thank the fucking stars.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">Uncle, I think the birria was just about done. How about we all sit at the table and discuss your day out?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">Yeah, that sounds like a great idea, Luna!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">(The four of them sit at the table and dish out large portions of birria alongside hefty crusts of bolillo bread.)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA&rsquo;S GRANDMOTHER: </span><span class="c0">Hm, the broth is just the right thickness in this! Are you sure you don&rsquo;t have any Mexican roots, Orion?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">UNCLE HUGO: </span><span class="c0">Could do with some more spice, though. Other than that, I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c6"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion barely chokes down the stew, taking heavy breaths to reduce the spiciness in his mouth while the three Hernandezes slurp away without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ll&ndash;ack&ndash;keep it in mind, Mr. Hernandez.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">After dinner, Luna&rsquo;s grandmother cajoles Uncle Hugo into cleaning the dishes and tidying up the table while she cuts slices of cheesecake for dessert. She sits with Orion and Luna at the counter, and happily gossips with Luna about the soap operas they watched earlier in the day while Orion interjects with an occasional &ldquo;oh, really?&rdquo; or &ldquo;I loved that part too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">When the cheesecake is finished, Uncle Hugo is still slaving away at the bowls and pots while Pancho keeps him company on the counter. Luna&rsquo;s grandmother yawns a little too widely, and checks her watch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA&rsquo;S GRANDMOTHER: </span><span class="c0">Well, it&rsquo;s about that time of the night for my beauty rest. Luna, don&rsquo;t forget to show Orion your surprise you had planned for today. You don&rsquo;t have to tell me what it is if you don&rsquo;t want to, but your abuela will find out one way or another!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She winks heartily, and Luna goes red. With that, she retreats to her room at the base of the stairs, closing the door behind her and laughing to herself. Uncle Hugo doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice. Outside, the earlier signs of rain take form, with miniscule water droplets beginning to patter at the house&rsquo;s windows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c0">I hate to invite myself, but shall we?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">Mm&hellip;okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">The two climb the stairs once again, and pad to Luna&rsquo;s room in the middle of the hall. The sun now barely </span><span class="c5">peeks</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;above the horizon, casting long shadows on the floorboards. Luna&rsquo;s room is simple, yet full of character, hosting several colorful abstract paintings and scores of potted plants whose bright tones clash with the simple gray </span><span class="c5">bedsheets</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and pillowcases.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion sits at the foot of Luna&rsquo;s bed, and the girl turns to her dresser, pulling from the top drawer the same small bag that Pancho had stolen earlier in the day. She sits next to Orion, and pulls the drawstring. Inside is a myriad of multi-colored taffies and soft candies, wrapped in thick paper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">These are&hellip;I made these for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Orion is taken aback, hesitating for a second before slowly reaching inside and grabbing a pastel pink and a light green one. He hands Luna the green one, and slowly pulls the paper off of the pink one, chewing it heartily. Sweet and salty tones coarse through his mouth, making his tongue grow heavier as he works at the candy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">ORION: </span><span class="c5">Theef&hellip;are&hellip;</span><span class="c2">fanfastic</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Luna laughs, a light, genuine melody. She chews at her own taffy with a great effort, and places her head on Orion&rsquo;s shoulder, this time with conviction and bravery. She softly whispers in his ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m glad you like them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">She deftly unwraps another taffy with one hand, and with the other, glides her small fingers along the sheets until they reach Orion&rsquo;s. She </span><span class="c5">laces</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;her fingers with his, and </span><span class="c5">opens</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;her mouth, signaling for Orion to do the same. With a great effort, he pulls his teeth apart and accepts another candy from her. She looks away at nothing in particular.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">LUNA: </span><span class="c0">You know, my uncle only has two guest rooms: this one, and the one my grandmother is staying in. You said you&rsquo;d spend the night, didn&rsquo;t you?</span></p></body></html>
